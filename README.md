# Heart Disease Prediction

This is a machine learning project where we predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various health data. The goal is to compare different algorithms to see which one works best for this task.

### What We Did
In this project, I used different machine learning models to predict heart disease, like:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Network (MLP)

I compared their performance and Random Forest gave the highest accuracy of **90.16%**.

### Dataset
The dataset used is from the UCI repository, which contains health data of individuals, including features like:
- Age, Sex, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol levels, etc.
- The target variable is whether a person has heart disease or not (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

### Key Insights
- **Random Forest** worked best, achieving an accuracy of **90.16%**.
- Some other models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes also performed decently with **85.25%** accuracy.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HeartDiseasePrediction.git
   cd HeartDiseasePrediction
